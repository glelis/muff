# Automated Positioner for Multifocal Stereo and Photometric Stereo Techniques

This project presents the development of a **low-cost automated positioner** designed to facilitate image capture for **Multifocus Stereo (MFS)** and **Photometric Stereo (PMS)** techniques in microscopic applications. Utilizing **additive manufacturing**, the system enables precise and accessible 3D image reconstruction.

## Features
- **Automated Image Capture**: Vertical motion through a stepper motor ensures stable and precise image stacking for MFS.
- **Advanced Illumination Control**: 24 strategically placed LEDs within a hemispherical chamber provide uniform lighting conditions for PMS.
- **Low-Cost and Open-Design**: Built using open-source software, 3D-printed parts, and readily available materials, ensuring easy reproducibility and adaptability.
- **Microscope Integration**: Compatible with low-cost digital microscopes for versatile applications.

## Key Components
- **Mechanical Structure**: Designed with 3D-printed parts and modular components for flexibility and easy assembly.
- **Electronics**: Arduino-based control for stepper motor and lighting management.
- **Software**: Python-based control program for operating the system, including motion and light sequencing.

## Applications
This positioner is ideal for research in:
- **Microscopy**
- **3D Object Reconstruction**
- **Material Analysis**
- Other scientific studies requiring precise imaging techniques.
